{% url about as about_url %}

<p>{%blocktrans%}MapOSMatic is a project entirely developed and
maintained by a team of volunteers (see
our <a href="{{about_url}}">About</a> page for details). However,
running the MapOSMatic service and making improvements to it have
various costs beyond the time of the volunteer
developers.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<p>{%blocktrans%}Therefore, we are currently seeking donations to help
us funding:{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<ul>
  <li>{%blocktrans%}Acquisition of a Solid-State Disk for the storage
  of our local copy of the OpenStreetMap database. A SSD drive
  performs 40 to 50 times better than the conventional hard drive we
  are using today, and would therefore help us to reduce the lag
  between our local database and the official one, providing more
  up-to-date maps. The cost of such hardware is about 500 to 700
  €.{%endblocktrans%}</li>

  <li>{%blocktrans%}Participation to the transportation expenses of
  the MapOSMatic developers when they gather for <i>hackfests</i>
  (meeting of developers). You can read
  our <a href="http://news.maposmatic.org">blog</a> to learn more
  about what we achieve during those hackfests. We usually implement a
  huge number of improvements, new features and bug fixes during those
  meetings. They take place during the holidays of the developers, and
  we would like to at least compensate their travel
  expenses.{%endblocktrans%}</li>

</ul>

<h2>{% trans "Donating?" %}</h2>

<p>{%blocktrans%}Donations can be done through the
well-known <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a> service. We
accept donations of any amount: all donations are
helpful, even the smallest ones.{%endblocktrans%}</p>
