<h2>History</h2>

<p>MapOSMatic has been started through the idea of Gilles Lamiral, an
OpenStreetMap and free software contributor from the area of Rennes,
France. Then, a group of crazy hackers, grouped together during a
one-week <i>Hackfest</i> in August 2009 brought the idea of Gilles
Lamiral to life by writing the code and named the project
MapOSMatic. Through this page, the group of crazy hackers would like
to thank Gilles for sharing his bright idea.</p>

<p>Of course, MapOSMatic is fully free software, licensed under the
AGPLv3.</p>

<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<p>On our server, we run a PostgreSQL server, with the PostGIS
extension. In this PostgreSQL server, we have loaded the full
OpenStreetMap data for the metropolitan France, using the <a
href="">dumps</a> and the <a href="">osm2pgsql</a> tool.</p>

<p>For the map rendering, we use the famous <a href="">Mapnik</a> with
the OpenStreetMap stylesheet available <a href="">in OpenStreetMap
Subversion repository</a>. Using Mapnik, we built <i>OCitySMap</i>, a
Python module that :</p>

<ul>

  <li>Renders the map using OpenStreetMap data and the OpenStreetMap
  Mapnik stylesheet</li>

  <li>Renders on top of the map, using Mapnik, the grid of 500 meters
  squares, the labels of the squares, and a few other informations on
  the map (copyright, scale, etc.)</li>

  <li>Renders an index of the streets, based on OpenStreetMap data and
  the intersection of the streets with the squares on the map</li>

</ul>

<p>This Python module can be used through a command-line provided with
OCitySMap, so everyone can run its own city-map rendering
suite. However, as the installation of the different components is
quite complicated, a small web service has been created on top of
it.</p>

<p>MapOSMatic is the association of a small web service developed on
top of the Django framework and a daemon that processes the rendering
requests.</p>
