<h1>{% trans "About" %}</h1>

<h2>{% trans "History" %}</h2>

<p>{%blocktrans%}MapOSMatic has been started thanks to an idea of
Gilles Lamiral, an OpenStreetMap and free software contributor. From
his idea, a group of crazy hackers, met together during a one-week
<i>Hackfest</i> in August 2009 and brought the idea of Gilles Lamiral
to life by writing the code and named the project MapOSMatic. The
group of crazy hackers would like to thank Gilles for sharing his
bright idea.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<p>{%blocktrans%}Of course, MapOSMatic is fully free software,
licensed under the AGPLv3.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<h2>How does it work ?</h2>

<p>{%blocktrans%}On our server, we run a PostgreSQL server, with the
PostGIS extension. In this PostgreSQL server, we have loaded the full
OpenStreetMap data for the metropolitan France, using the <a
href="">dumps</a> and the <a href="">osm2pgsql</a>
tool.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<p>{%blocktrans%}For the map rendering, we use the famous <a
href="">Mapnik</a> with the OpenStreetMap stylesheet available <a
href="">in OpenStreetMap Subversion repository</a>. Using Mapnik and
Cairo, we built <i>OCitySMap</i>, a Python module that
:{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<ul>

  <li>{%blocktrans%}Renders the map using OpenStreetMap data and the
  OpenStreetMap Mapnik stylesheet{%endblocktrans%}</li>

  <li>{%blocktrans%}Renders on top of the map, using Mapnik, the grid
  of 500 meters squares, the labels of the squares, and a few other
  informations on the map (copyright, scale, etc.){%endblocktrans%}</li>

  <li>{%blocktrans%}Renders an index of the streets, based on
  OpenStreetMap data and the intersection of the streets with the
  squares on the map{%endblocktrans%}</li>

</ul>

<p>{%blocktrans%}This Python module can be used through a command-line
provided with OCitySMap, so everyone can run its own city-map
rendering suite. However, as the installation of the different
components is quite complicated, a small web service has been created
on top of it so that end-users can easily generate and use
OpenStreetMap city maps.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<p>{%blocktrans%}This web service has been called <i>MapOSMatic</i>,
like <i>map-o-matic</i> but with a reference to OpenStreetMap
(OSM). The web service is written in Python using Django and is
responsible for storing the rendering requests and displaying the
result of these requests. The rendering itself takes place
asynchronously through the <i>maposmaticd</i> daemon, so that only one
rendering at a time is being processed, which is very important
because of the CPU and I/O intensive nature of the map rendering
process.{%endblocktrans%}</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>{%blocktrans%}As stated above, both <i>OCitySMap</i> and
<i>MapOSMatic</i> are fully free software, so you're invited to
contribute. Here are the few starting points to help
