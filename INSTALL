INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

www/ contains the Django web application. The file
www/settings_local.py.template must be copied to www/settings_local.py
and adapted to the installation configuration. Likewise for
www/maposmatic.wsgi-template and scripts/maposmaticd.sh

The database must be initialize with the tables needed for MapOSMatic,
using :

 ./www/manage.py syncdb

scripts/maposmaticd is the daemon that should be run in the
background. It will fetch rendering jobs from the database and put the
results in a directory, as specified in the settings_local.py file.

To get proper internationalisation, in www/, run:
 python /usr/share/python-support/python-django/django/bin/django-admin.py compilemessages
