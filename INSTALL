INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

Dependencies
------------

MapOSMatic depends on Python, Django and python-psycodg2. You will also most
likely need a working PostGIS installation for the entire pipeline to run.


Setup
-----

The www/ directory contains the Django web application. The file
www/settings_local.py.template must be copied to www/settings_local.py and
modified to match your installation configuration.

Likewise for www/maposmatic.wsgi-template and scripts/maposmaticd.sh.

The database must then be initialized with the tables needed for MapOSMatic,
using :

  python www/manage.py syncdb

The scripts/maposmaticd daemon should be run in the background. It will fetch
rendering jobs from the database and put the results in a directory, as
specified in the settings_local.py file.


Internationalization
--------------------

To get proper internationalisation, you need to compile the gettext locale files:

  django-admin compilemessages

Don't forget to restart the Django server or it won't pick up the new
translated strings!
